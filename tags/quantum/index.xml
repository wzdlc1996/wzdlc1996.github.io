      <title>Introduction to Weak Measurements and Weak Values</title>
      <link>https://wzdlc1996.github.io/artic/qtmmsmt/weakmeas/</link>

      <guid>https://wzdlc1996.github.io/artic/qtmmsmt/weakmeas/</guid>
      <description>An introduction to weak measurement and weak values. Using the simplest model and perturbation theory to analyze a class of weak measurement process and the concept of weak values. This article gives a comparison between weak measurement and the ordinary measurement in quantum mechanics(which is called as strong measurement) and some interesting application of weak values.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Relativistic Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>The simple introduction to Relativistic Quantum Mechanics. Mainly about the Dirac equation. Gives some basic understanding about the Dirac equation(in Dirac representation). Get to know some basic consequences of Dirac equation: Orbital angular momentum is not conserved, but the total angular momentum; Zeeman coupling term with g factor is 2; Spin-orbit coupling term and Zitterbewegung: Dirac particle cannot be &amp;ldquo;at rest&amp;rdquo; in classical sense. Even with zero momentum and without external potential, it seems to be oscillating.</description>
