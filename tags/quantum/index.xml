      <title>Time in Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>Time in quantum mechanics is always left as an parameter in the equation of motion. In the non-relativistic quantum theory we find time in the derivative of wavefunction, while in the relativistic quantum field theory, it is not at the same status of spatial position: we introduce the space-time dependent field operator only for Lorentz covariance for the equation of motion. Whether can we have an intrinsic interpretation of time flow in quantum mechanics was early discussed by Don Page and William Wootters with the purpose to match the energy superselection rule. Though it may not be a correct theory for our world or even &amp;lsquo;close&amp;rsquo; to it, it is worthy to discuss in modern view here as a consistent approach to the time puzzle.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning: Quantum Algorithms to Classical Data</title>
      <link>https://wzdlc1996.github.io/artic/physics/qmachinelearning/</link>

      <description>Quantum machine learning is the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning programs. Generally, we have four different approaches for this purpose, by the type of data (quantum state/data or classical data) and type of algorithm or platform (quantum algorithm/computer or classical algorithm/computer). In this report, we focus on an elementary discussion about aspect of the quantum approach to classical data. The more attractive part about quantum approach to quantum data will be left for future posts.</description>

      <title>Time Travel and Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>Time travel, as a famous concept in science fiction, fascinates people for a long time. However for physicists, this is not only a beautiful dream, but also a interesting problem to discuss mathematically. In the community, there are generally two directions about time travel: (1) does it exist and (2) if it indeed exists, what can we do. In this report, we discuss the application of time travel mainly in the field of quantum computation</description>

      <description>An introduction to weak measurement and weak values. Using the simplest model and perturbation theory to analyze a class of weak measurement process and the concept of weak values. This article gives a comparison between weak measurement and the ordinary measurement in quantum mechanics(which is called as strong measurement) and some interesting application of weak values.</description>

      <title>Interacting Field Theory: Scattering Theory</title>

      <description>We will review the scattering theory which has been studied in quantum-mechanics. The main character is the S-matrix and how to compute cross section by it. Then we will introduce the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction fomula, which will show the connection between time-ordered Green&amp;rsquo;s function and S-matrix in scattering theory. The former can be computed by the Feynman Diagram and Feynman Rule which we have studied in the last section, and the latter is the only thing we can measure in experiments.</description>

      <title>Interacting Field Theory: Time-ordered Green&#39;s Function</title>

      <description>We will introduce the basic Field Theory with interaction considered, which is the main propose of Field Theory actually. We will use the perturbation theory here. And what can we talk is only perturbation-property of Field theory. Our goal is to show the constraint of the form of Lagrangian in Interacting Field Theory. Then we will show the perturbation expansion of the time-ordered Green&amp;rsquo;s function and the corresponding method: Feynman Diagram and Feynman Rules. Green&amp;rsquo;s Function is widely used in field theory, especially in condensed matter theory. But in QFT we just care the connection between it and scattering theory, which will be discussed in next section.</description>

      <description>The canonical quantization of vector Field(Maxwell Field). One can find that the usual quantization procedure(directly using of commutation relationship) does not work for it, because of the Gauge Symmetry. We will introduce the Gupta-Bleuler quantization procedure. It clearly keeps the Lorentz covariance but leads to a Hilbert space with negative matric. For free Maxwell field we can separate them totally, so the probability interpretation will not destroyed. Then we will computation of propagator and do some discussion. At last we will discuss the discrete symmetry of Maxwell Field in Quantum Theory</description>

      <description>The simple introduction to Relativistic Quantum Mechanics. Mainly about the Dirac equation. Gives some basic understanding about the Dirac equation(in Dirac representation). Get to know some basic consequences of Dirac equation: Orbital angular momentum is not conserved, but the total angular momentum; Zeeman coupling term with g factor is 2; Spin-orbit coupling term and Zitterbewegung: Dirac particle cannot be &amp;ldquo;at rest&amp;rdquo; in classical sense. Even with zero momentum and without external potential, it seems to be oscillating.</description>

      <description>The canonical quantization of Spinor Field(Dirac Field). One can find that the usual quantization procedure(canonical commutation relationship) does not work for it, because it leads to the Hamiltonian with no lower bound. To quantize it correctly, we need modify it as the anti-commutation relationship, which means that Dirac particles are Fermions. Then we will computation of propagator and do some discussion. At last we will discuss the discrete symmetry of Dirac Field in Quantum Theory</description>
