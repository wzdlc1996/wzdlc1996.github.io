      <description>In this note, we will generally discuss the basic conceptions of measurement-based quantum computing(MBQC). We focus on the workflow of MBQC and how to transpile a circuit-based model to MBQC. The parallization for quantum computing and other optimizations are not fully covered but the references are offered. Finally, we discuss the development of MBQC in theoretical perspective.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning: Quantum Algorithms to Classical Data</title>

      <description>Quantum machine learning is the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning programs. Generally, we have four different approaches for this purpose, by the type of data (quantum state/data or classical data) and type of algorithm or platform (quantum algorithm/computer or classical algorithm/computer). In this report, we focus on an elementary discussion about aspect of the quantum approach to classical data. The more attractive part about quantum approach to quantum data will be left for future posts.</description>

      <title>Time Travel and Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>Time travel, as a famous concept in science fiction, fascinates people for a long time. However for physicists, this is not only a beautiful dream, but also a interesting problem to discuss mathematically. In the community, there are generally two directions about time travel: (1) does it exist and (2) if it indeed exists, what can we do. In this report, we discuss the application of time travel mainly in the field of quantum computation</description>
