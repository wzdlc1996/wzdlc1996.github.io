      <description>Introduction Zeno Paradox , or Arrow paradox of Zeno Paradoxes argues that [Wiki page]:
 If everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless
 In 1977, Misra and Sudarshan showed [Misra 1977], based on the quantum measurement theory, that an unstable particle will never be found to decay if it is continuously observed [Petrosky 1990]. This effect is known as Quantum Zeno Effect(QZE) or Turing Paradox now.
The first experiment of observing the QZE is made by Itano, Heinzen, Bolligner and Wineland in 1990. [Itano 1990] . There are also some other new study in this field, like inverse quantum Zeno effect or Anti-Zeno Effect(AZE) of that the decay can be accelerated by the measurements [Facchi 2000], QZE and AZE by general measurements(without instantaneousness) [Kazuki 2005].
Here we will introduce the basic theory about QZE and analyze the periodic measurement of a quantum system.
Unstable System We will discuss the concept unstable system first of all. Generally speaking, unstable systems are those systems who have a finite life time will never return to the initial state spontaneously.</description>
