      <description>Introduction Quantum measurement is always one of the most fascinating questions in quantum mechanics. With the limitation caused by the uncertainty principle, how to find a way to perform a measurement but introduce as little disturbance as possible on the object attracts more and more people in recent years. The theory of weak measurement as a generalization of the ordinary measurement in quantum mechanics was born in such the atmosphere.</description>

      <description>Introduction Zeno Paradox , or Arrow paradox of Zeno Paradoxes argues that [Wiki page]:
 If everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless
 In 1977, Misra and Sudarshan showed [Misra 1977], based on the quantum measurement theory, that an unstable particle will never be found to decay if it is continuously observed [Petrosky 1990].</description>
