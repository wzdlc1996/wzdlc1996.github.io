      <description>An introduction to weak measurement and weak values. Using the simplest model and perturbation theory to analyze a class of weak measurement process and the concept of weak values. This article gives a comparison between weak measurement and the ordinary measurement in quantum mechanics(which is called as strong measurement) and some interesting application of weak values.</description>
