      <description>Classnote for the class in PKU: &amp;lsquo;Quantum Theory for Manybody System&amp;rsquo;. This note give a simple review for the path integral in coordinate space, and generalized it from single particle to many body system with the closure relation generated by coherent state. With the path integral formalism one can further understand the Green&amp;rsquo;s function.</description>

      <description>Classnote for the class in PKU: &amp;lsquo;Quantum Theory for Manybody System&amp;rsquo;. This note gives a review for theory of Green&amp;rsquo;s function. Covers the definition of real-time Green&amp;rsquo;s function of the many body theory at temperature is zero, and the thermal Green&amp;rsquo;s function , or temperature Green&amp;rsquo;s function. And discussion how to extract information from Green&amp;rsquo;s function.</description>

      <title>Manybody: Coherent State</title>
      <link>https://wzdlc1996.github.io/notes/qm/manybody1/</link>

      <description>This is the first classnote for the class in PKU: &amp;lsquo;Quantum Theory for Manybody System&amp;rsquo;. This note gives a brief introduction to Grassmann numbers and then define the generic coherent states of Boson and Fermion, and discuss their properties. The coherent state is widely used in the path integral expression for many body system, or the field theory.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Relativistic Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <guid>https://wzdlc1996.github.io/notes/qm/relativisticqm/</guid>
      <description>The simple introduction to Relativistic Quantum Mechanics. Mainly about the Dirac equation. Gives some basic understanding about the Dirac equation(in Dirac representation). Get to know some basic consequences of Dirac equation: Orbital angular momentum is not conserved, but the total angular momentum; Zeeman coupling term with g factor is 2; Spin-orbit coupling term and Zitterbewegung: Dirac particle cannot be &amp;ldquo;at rest&amp;rdquo; in classical sense. Even with zero momentum and without external potential, it seems to be oscillating.</description>
