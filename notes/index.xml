      <description>Classnote for the class in PKU: &amp;lsquo;Quantum Theory for Manybody System&amp;rsquo;. This note give a simple review for the path integral in coordinate space, and generalized it from single particle to many body system with the closure relation generated by coherent state. With the path integral formalism one can further understand the Green&amp;rsquo;s function.</description>

      <description>Classnote for the class in PKU: &amp;lsquo;Quantum Theory for Manybody System&amp;rsquo;. This note gives a review for theory of Green&amp;rsquo;s function. Covers the definition of real-time Green&amp;rsquo;s function of the many body theory at temperature is zero, and the thermal Green&amp;rsquo;s function , or temperature Green&amp;rsquo;s function. And discussion how to extract information from Green&amp;rsquo;s function.</description>

      <description>This is the first classnote for the class in PKU: &amp;lsquo;Quantum Theory for Manybody System&amp;rsquo;. This note gives a brief introduction to Grassmann numbers and then define the generic coherent states of Boson and Fermion, and discuss their properties. The coherent state is widely used in the path integral expression for many body system, or the field theory.</description>

      <description>We will review the scattering theory which has been studied in quantum-mechanics. The main character is the S-matrix and how to compute cross section by it. Then we will introduce the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann reduction fomula, which will show the connection between time-ordered Green&amp;rsquo;s function and S-matrix in scattering theory. The former can be computed by the Feynman Diagram and Feynman Rule which we have studied in the last section, and the latter is the only thing we can measure in experiments.</description>

      <description>We will introduce the basic Field Theory with interaction considered, which is the main propose of Field Theory actually. We will use the perturbation theory here. And what can we talk is only perturbation-property of Field theory. Our goal is to show the constraint of the form of Lagrangian in Interacting Field Theory. Then we will show the perturbation expansion of the time-ordered Green&amp;rsquo;s function and the corresponding method: Feynman Diagram and Feynman Rules. Green&amp;rsquo;s Function is widely used in field theory, especially in condensed matter theory. But in QFT we just care the connection between it and scattering theory, which will be discussed in next section.</description>

      <description>The canonical quantization of vector Field(Maxwell Field). One can find that the usual quantization procedure(directly using of commutation relationship) does not work for it, because of the Gauge Symmetry. We will introduce the Gupta-Bleuler quantization procedure. It clearly keeps the Lorentz covariance but leads to a Hilbert space with negative matric. For free Maxwell field we can separate them totally, so the probability interpretation will not destroyed. Then we will computation of propagator and do some discussion. At last we will discuss the discrete symmetry of Maxwell Field in Quantum Theory</description>

      <description>The simple introduction to Relativistic Quantum Mechanics. Mainly about the Dirac equation. Gives some basic understanding about the Dirac equation(in Dirac representation). Get to know some basic consequences of Dirac equation: Orbital angular momentum is not conserved, but the total angular momentum; Zeeman coupling term with g factor is 2; Spin-orbit coupling term and Zitterbewegung: Dirac particle cannot be &amp;ldquo;at rest&amp;rdquo; in classical sense. Even with zero momentum and without external potential, it seems to be oscillating.</description>

      <description>The canonical quantization of Spinor Field(Dirac Field). One can find that the usual quantization procedure(canonical commutation relationship) does not work for it, because it leads to the Hamiltonian with no lower bound. To quantize it correctly, we need modify it as the anti-commutation relationship, which means that Dirac particles are Fermions. Then we will computation of propagator and do some discussion. At last we will discuss the discrete symmetry of Dirac Field in Quantum Theory</description>

      <description>Random Variable Introduction to Probability Theory Probability Space [Definition] : A Probability Space is a triplet $(\Omega, \mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ of three elements:
 $\Omega$ is a set (called Sample Space) . $\mathcal{F}$ is a Sigma Algebra on $\Omega$. $\mathcal{F}$ is a collection of subsets of $\Omega$ and has the following properties:  $\Omega, \varnothing \in \mathcal{F}$ $A\in \mathcal{F} \Rightarrow A^c \equiv \Omega \setminus A \in \mathcal{F}$ A sequence of sets ${A_i}{i=1}^{\infty}$ in which $A_i \in \mathcal{F}$, then $\bigcup{j=1}^{\infty} A_j \in \mathcal{F}$   $\mathbb{P}$ is a Probability Measure: $\mathbb{P}: \mathcal{F}\rightarrow [0,1]$ and has the following properties:  (Normalization)$\mathbb{P}(\Omega) = 1$ (Countably additive)$A_1,A_2,\cdots \in \mathcal{F} \ , \ A_i\bigcap A_j=\varnothing \Rightarrow \mathbb{P}(\bigcup_{j=1}^{\infty} A_j) = \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} \mathbb{P}(A_j)$    [Definition] : A Measurable (real-valued) Function on a Measurable Space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$ is a function $f:\Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which has the property:</description>
