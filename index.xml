      <description>Introduction Zeno Paradox , or Arrow paradox of Zeno Paradoxes argues that [Wiki page]:
 If everything when it occupies an equal space is at rest, and if that which is in locomotion is always occupying such a space at any moment, the flying arrow is therefore motionless
 In 1977, Misra and Sudarshan showed [Misra 1977], based on the quantum measurement theory, that an unstable particle will never be found to decay if it is continuously observed [Petrosky 1990]. This effect is known as Quantum Zeno Effect(QZE) or Turing Paradox now.
The first experiment of observing the QZE is made by Itano, Heinzen, Bolligner and Wineland in 1990. [Itano 1990] . There are also some other new study in this field, like inverse quantum Zeno effect or Anti-Zeno Effect(AZE) of that the decay can be accelerated by the measurements [Facchi 2000], QZE and AZE by general measurements(without instantaneousness) [Kazuki 2005].
Here we will introduce the basic theory about QZE and analyze the periodic measurement of a quantum system.
Unstable System We will discuss the concept unstable system first of all. Generally speaking, unstable systems are those systems who have a finite life time will never return to the initial state spontaneously.</description>

      <description> Switch HSV to A2DP A2DP not working with PulseAudio Here is the explanation from ArchWiki: A2DP not working with PulseAudio
With Blueman-manager version 2.06 and PulseAudio version 12.2 , there is an issue that one cannot switch to A2DP with GUI. It will post the error message that Fail to change profile to A2DP . It seems only happening in Gnome. One need to avoid the GDM to start PulseAudio. The solution is:
 Edit /etc/pulse/default.pa to close the default Bluetooth discover of pulse.
nano /etc/pulse/default.pa # load-module module-bluetooth-discover  Edit /usr/bin/start-pulseaudio-x11 to open bluetooth discover by pactl . It should be:
nano /usr/bin/start-pulseaudio-x11 if ... if [ x”$SESSION_MANAGER” != x ] ; then /usr/bin/pactl load-module module-x11-xsmp “display=$DISPLAY session_manager=$SESSION_MANAGER” &amp;gt; /dev/null fi #Insert this line# /usr/bin/pactl load-module module-bluetooth-discover fi  Usually this block of code is at the last line.
  This solution is from:

      <description>Introduction Now we will study Fields . Each point of a (finite or infinite) region in space will be associated with some continuous field variable which will be denoted by $\phi(\bm{x},t)$. Then the field is a system with an infinite number(uncountable) of degrees of freedom.  The dynamical variables of the theory are now the values of the field $\phi(\bm{x})$ at each point of space . In general, the field can contain some internal degrees of freedom.
The Lagrange function now is a functional of the field and its differential respects to time:
$$L(t) = L[\phi(\bm{x},t),\partial_t\phi(\bm{x},t)]$$ In general, it depends on the value of $\phi,\partial_t \phi$ at all points in space. Note that the functional does not depend on the coordinate $\bm{x}$ itself.
The Lagrangian Formalism In this series, we will only study a class of fields, which is called as the local field theories without high order of time-derivative. Namely:
$$L(t) = \int \td^3 \bm{x} \mathcal{L}(\phi(\bm{x},t),\nabla \phi(\bm{x},t),\partial_{t}\phi(\bm{x},t))$$ There should be no high order time-derivative in right-hand-side. Function $\mathcal{L}$ is called Lagrange density or Lagrangian in this series. The gradient describes the local interaction of field.
One can write a covariant Action abstractly :
$$S=\int \td^4 x \mathcal{L}(\phi(x),\partial_\mu \phi(x))$$ where $x$ denotes the 4-vector $(\bm{x},t)$ and $\td^4x$ is the invariant-volume of cell.</description>

      <description>SU(2) and SO(3) Groups Defining SO(3) Group [Definition] : SO(3) Group is the group of proper rotations in 3-dimensional space. With $\bm{r}=(x,y,z)^T$ , it is the set of 3x3 matrices $\bm{R}$ which satisfy:
$$\bm{R}^T \bm{R}= \bm{1} , \ \ \det \bm{R}=1$$ SO(3) together with spatial inversion form the O(3) group: $\text{SO}(3) \bigcup I \text{SO}(3) = \text{O}(3)$
Parameterizing SO(3) Group There are two ways to parameterize the SO(3) group:
 Any SO(3) rotation can be descriped by angle $\theta$ and axis $\bm{n}$ . It can be denoted by: $\bm{R}_{\bm{n}}(\theta)$ , and according to the definition, we have following properties:
 $\bm{R}_{\bm{n}}(\theta)^{-1}=\bm{R}_{\bm{n}}(-\theta)$ $\bm{R}_{\bm{n}}(\theta) = \bm{R}_{-\bm{n}}(-\theta)$ $\bm{R}&#39;\bm{R}_n(\theta)(\bm{R}&#39;)^{-1} = \bm{R}_{\bm{R}&#39;\bm{n}}(\theta)$  One can also derive the matrix form of $\bm{R}_{\bm{n}}(\theta)$ directly:
$$\bm{R}_{\bm{n}}(\theta) \bm{x} = (\bm{x}\cdot \bm{n})\bm{n} +(\bm{x}-(\bm{x}\cdot \bm{n})\bm{n})\cos\theta + (\bm{n}\times \bm{x})\sin\theta $$  Proof  For arbitrary vector $\bm{x}$ , one can always decompose it along $\bm{n}$ and the vertical one:
$$\bm{x} = \bm{x}-(\bm{x}\cdot \bm{n})\bm{n} + (\bm{x}\cdot \bm{n})\bm{n}$$ The component along $\bm{n}$ will be invariant, but the vertical one will rotate with $\theta$ . One the plane, we have two linear-independent vectors:
$$\begin{aligned} \bm{x}_1 &amp;= \bm{x}-(\bm{x}\cdot\bm{n})\bm{n} \\ \bm{x}_2 &amp;= - \bm{x}_1 \times \bm{n} = \bm{n}\times \bm{x} \end{aligned}$$ With $\theta$ means counterclockwise rotation, that is from $\bm{x}_1$ to $\bm{x}_2$ .</description>

      <description>Basic of Group Theory Definitions [Definition] : a Group is a set $G$ with a binary multiplication : $\circ : G\times G\rightarrow G$ defined. satisfying:
 Associativity : $f\circ (g\circ h) = (f\circ g)\circ h$ . In the following $\circ$ will be omitted Existence of identity : $\exists 1 \in G \Rightarrow(\forall g \in G \Rightarrow 1g=g1=g)$ Existence of inverse : $\forall g \in G \exists g^{-1}\in G \Rightarrow g^{-1}g = g g^{-1} =1$  Some concepts about Group are listed following:
 Order of group : $|G|$ is the number of finite group elements Order of an element : $|g|$ is the minimal integer $n$ s.t. $g^n=1$ , or $\infty$ if $n$ does not exist Abelian group :if $\forall g,h\in G \Rightarrow gh=hg $ subgroup : $H\leq G$ : a subset $H\subset G$ which is also a group under multiplication $\circ$ left(right) coset : $gH(Hg) := \{gh(hg) : h\in H \}$ Normal subgroup : $H \unlhd G$ a subgroup satisfying $\forall g \in G \Rightarrow gH=Hg$ Quotient group : $G/H$ is the group of cosets for normal subgroup $H$ of $G$:
$$H\unlhd G \Rightarrow G/H := \{gH : g\in G \} \text{ with } a,b\in G/H \Rightarrow a\circ b :=g_a g_b H \in G/H$$ Conjugacy class : $f,h\in G$ are conjugate if $\exists g \in G \Rightarrow gfg^{-1}=h$ all elements conjugate to $f$ form the conjugacy class of $f$</description>

      <description>Time Evolution Unitary Time Evolution [Assumption] : The basic assumption of quantum dynamics is that , the time evolution of a closed system is unitary . [Definition] : Time evolution operator : That means if we note the quantum state at time $t$ as $\ket{\psi(t)}$ , then there is a Unitary operator $\hat U(t&#39;,t)$ , one have:
$$\ket{\psi(t&#39;)} = \hat U(t&#39;,t)\ket{\psi(t)}$$ The evolution operator has the following property:
$$\hat U(t&#39;&#39;,t&#39;)\hat U(t&#39;,t)=\hat U(t&#39;&#39;,t) \ \ ; \ \hat U(t,t)=\hat 1$$ It is usually continuous and reversible
The infinitesimal time evolution:
$$\hat U(t+\td t,t) = \hat 1 -\frac {\ti} {\hbar} \hat H(t)\td t +O(dt^2)$$ Where the Hamiltonian is:
$$\hat H(t) = \ti \hbar \frac {\td} {\td t&#39;} \hat U(t&#39;,t)\Big|_{t&#39;=t}=\ti \hbar \frac {\td \hat U(t&#39;,t)} {\td t&#39;} \hat U^{\dagger}(t&#39;,t)\Big|_{t&#39;=t}$$ Then for $(\partial_1 \hat U(t&#39;,t))\hat U^{\dagger}(t&#39;,t)+\hat U(t&#39;,t)\partial_1\hat U^{\dagger}(t&#39;,t)=0$ , one can find that $\hat H$ is Hermitian Moreover, one can prove that $\frac {\td \hat U(t&#39;,t)} {\td t&#39;} \hat U^{\dagger}(t&#39;,t)$ is independent to $t$:
 Proof  $$\begin{aligned}[] \frac {\td \hat U(t,t_0)} {\td t} \hat U^{\dagger}(t,t_0) &amp;= \frac {\td \hat U(t,t&#39;_0)} {\td t} \hat U(t&#39;_0,t_0) (\hat U(t,t&#39;_0)\hat U(t&#39;_0,t_0))^{\dagger} \\ &amp;= \frac {\td \hat U(t,t&#39;_0)} {\td t} \hat U(t&#39;_0,t_0) \hat U^{\dagger}(t&#39;_0,t_0) \hat U^{\dagger}(t,t&#39;_0) \\ &amp;= \frac {\td \hat U(t,t&#39;_0)} {\td t} \hat U^{\dagger}(t,t&#39;_0) \end{aligned}$$ Q.</description>

      <description>Outline Fock space is the direct sum of identical particle Hilbert space for all different particle numbers:
$$\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{H}_0\oplus \mathcal{H}_1 \oplus\cdots$$ Many-body Hilbert space of fermions and bosons is (Anti-)Symmetrized tensor product space:
 $n$-body Hilbert space for identical particles $\mathcal{H}_n$ is a subspace of $(\mathcal{H})^{\otimes n}$ $\mathcal{H}_n$ is the image of multi-linear (anti-)symmetrization mapping:
$$\mathcal{S}:(\mathcal{H}_1)^{\otimes n}\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_n$$ The (anti-)symmetrization mapping is defined on a tensor product basis as:
$$\begin{aligned} \mathcal{S}:\ket{1}\cdots\ket{n}\mapsto \frac 1 {\sqrt{n!}}\sum_{\sigma\in S_n} \ket{\sigma(1)}\cdots\ket{\sigma(n)} \ \ &amp; \text{for boson} \\ \mathcal{S}:\ket{1}\cdots\ket{n}\mapsto \frac 1 {\sqrt{n!}}\sum_{\sigma\in S_n} (-1)^{\sigma} \ket{\sigma(1)}\cdots\ket{\sigma(n)} \ \ &amp; \text{for fermion} \end{aligned}$$  Second quantization language and some simple many-body wavefunction
The Fock Space Permutation Group [Definition] : permutation is a map : $\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; n \\ \sigma(1) &amp;amp; \sigma(2) &amp;amp; \cdots &amp;amp; \sigma(n)\end{pmatrix}\equiv\{j,\sigma(j)\}$ means replacing $j$ by $\sigma(j)$ , and $\sigma(j)\in\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$ [Definition] : Transposition : $(i,j)$ means exchange $i$ and $j$ while keeping others fixed. Any permutation can be represented as a product of transpositions of neighbors $(i,i+1)$ , and the number of transpositions is defined as the parity of the permutation. The sign(signature) of a permutation : $(-1)^{\sigma}$ , is $+1$ for even one and $-1$ for odd one. It can be rewritten as:</description>

      <description>Outline    Terminologies Explanation     Hilbert Space: $\mathcal{H}$ Linear space equipped with an inner product   quantum states(&amp;ldquo;ket&amp;rdquo;) : $\ket{\psi}$ elements in the linear space $\mathcal{H}$   &amp;ldquo;bra&amp;rdquo; : $\bra{\psi}$ linear functionals defined on $\mathcal{H}$ : $\mathcal{H}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$   quantum mechanical operators linear mappings : $\mathcal{H}_1\rightarrow \mathcal{H}_2$    The Hilbert Space Wavefunction The Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}(V)$ defined on a coordinate space $V$ is a complex linear space formed by all normalizable wavefunction defined on $V$. More strictly we should call it Bogoliubov space And the closeness ($\lambda_1 \psi_1+\lambda_2\psi_2$ is normalizable if $\psi_i$ are normalizable) is hold indeed, one can check it by Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality. A natural inner product can be defined on Hilbert space, as the overlap of two wavefunctions $\phi ,\psi$ :
$$(\phi,\psi) := \int \phi^*(\bm{x}) \psi(\bm{x})\td V$$ Satisfying the three Axioms :
 Hermiticity : $(\phi,\psi)=(\psi,\phi)^*$ Linearity : $(\phi,\lambda_1\psi_1+\lambda_2\psi_2)=\lambda_1 (\phi,\psi_1)+\lambda_2 (\phi,\psi_2) \ \ \text{for } \lambda_1,\lambda_2 \in \mathbb{C}$ Positive definiteness : $(\psi,\psi)\geq 0 , \text{ and } \Big((\psi,\psi)=0 \Leftrightarrow \psi=0 \Big)$  The third axiom above leads to a useful consiquence:
The Gram matrix $G_{i,j}=(\psi_i,\psi_j)$ of a set of wavefunction is Hermitian and positive semi-definite.
 Proof  For the positive definiteness of inner product, we have:</description>

      <description>Minkowski Spacetime The Structure of Minkowski Spacetime From now on we will study in Minkowski spacetime (non-General Relativity) .
[Definition] : Minkowski spacetime (non-curved) is a 4-dimension real linear space:
$$\mathcal{M} = \{x=(x^0,x^1,x^2,x^3)\equiv (x^0,\bm{x}) : x^{\mu}\in \mathbb{R} \}$$ Usually we note the vector as a lowercase of letter with a Greek superscript like$x\sim x^{\mu}$and ignore the basis. with the metric :
$$\eta_{\mu\nu}=\eta^{\mu\nu} = (+,-,-,-)$$ And dual vector of $x$ :
$$x_ {\mu} = \eta_ {\mu\nu}x^{\nu}$$ where the Einstein Summation Convention has been applied. The inner product in Minkowski spacetime is:
$$(x,y) := x^{\mu}y_{\mu} = x_{\mu}y^{\mu} = \eta_{\mu\nu}x^{\mu}y^{\nu}$$ Lorentz Transformation [Definition] : Lorentz Transformation is a linear transformation which hold the inner product invariant:
$$\Lambda : \mathcal{M}\ni x^{\mu} \mapsto \mathcal{M} \ni x&#39;^{\mu} = \Lambda^{\mu}_{\ \ \ \ \nu} x ^{\nu}$$ With $\forall x,y\in \mathcal{M} , (\Lambda x,\Lambda y) = (x,y) \Rightarrow \eta_{\mu\nu}\Lambda^{\mu}_{\ \ \ \ \alpha} \Lambda^{\nu}_{\ \ \ \ \beta} = \eta_{\alpha\beta}$ Or equivalently:$\Lambda^{\mu}_{\ \ \ \ \alpha} \Lambda_{\mu \beta} = \eta_{\alpha\beta}$
[Theorem] : By$\eta_{\mu\lambda}\eta^{\lambda\nu}=\delta_{\mu}^{\nu}$, we have:
$$(\Lambda^{-1})^{\mu}_{\ \ \ \ \nu} = \Lambda_{\nu}^{\ \ \ \ \mu}$$  Proof  We have$\Lambda^{\mu}_{\ \ \ \ \alpha}\Lambda^{\nu}_{\ \ \ \ \beta} \eta_{\mu\nu} = \eta_{\alpha\beta}$, for$\eta_{\alpha\gamma}\eta^{\gamma\beta} \equiv \eta_{\alpha}^{\beta} = \delta_{\alpha}^{\beta}$, we have:</description>

      <description>Introduction usually, linux has two method to handle the dual-graphic card. The difference between them are:
   Method Advantages Disadvantages     Bumblebee Uses dGPU(descrete) only when requested. Saving power Manjaro default Some overhead so lower raw performance   PRIME Uses the dGPU directly , Better performance dGPU and iGPU(integrated) both powered on constantly need manual configuration    Step 1. Remove Bumblebee Usually manjaro can be easily installed choosing the free drive mode, but nouveau is hard to use. And sometimes it make user cannot entry the x-system. One way is that noting nouveau in blacklist , use command:
sudo nano /etc/modprob.d/usrBlack.blacklist blacklist nouveau  Then to use the graphic card, one can run mhwd-tui to install the non-free driver and Bumblebee to manage dual graphic card. First of all, we need uninstall bumblebee, and may the graphic card driver installed by mhwd. One can simply remove them using the mhwd command in terminal or via Manjaro Settings Manager In other distribution, the work is the same. User can using their package manager to do it. Or more directly, do NOT install bumblebee, directly install PRIME after truning off nouveau.
Step 2. Install Closed-source Driver One can follow the following articles to install the driver according to what he use:</description>
