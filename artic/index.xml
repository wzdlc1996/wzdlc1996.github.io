      <title>Time in Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>Time in quantum mechanics is always left as an parameter in the equation of motion. In the non-relativistic quantum theory we find time in the derivative of wavefunction, while in the relativistic quantum field theory, it is not at the same status of spatial position: we introduce the space-time dependent field operator only for Lorentz covariance for the equation of motion. Whether can we have an intrinsic interpretation of time flow in quantum mechanics was early discussed by Don Page and William Wootters with the purpose to match the energy superselection rule. Though it may not be a correct theory for our world or even &amp;lsquo;close&amp;rsquo; to it, it is worthy to discuss in modern view here as a consistent approach to the time puzzle.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning: Quantum Algorithms to Classical Data</title>
      <link>https://wzdlc1996.github.io/artic/physics/qmachinelearning/</link>

      <description>Quantum machine learning is the integration of quantum algorithms within machine learning programs. Generally, we have four different approaches for this purpose, by the type of data (quantum state/data or classical data) and type of algorithm or platform (quantum algorithm/computer or classical algorithm/computer). In this report, we focus on an elementary discussion about aspect of the quantum approach to classical data. The more attractive part about quantum approach to quantum data will be left for future posts.</description>

      <title>Time Travel and Quantum Computation</title>

      <description>Time travel, as a famous concept in science fiction, fascinates people for a long time. However for physicists, this is not only a beautiful dream, but also a interesting problem to discuss mathematically. In the community, there are generally two directions about time travel: (1) does it exist and (2) if it indeed exists, what can we do. In this report, we discuss the application of time travel mainly in the field of quantum computation</description>

      <title>对漫画柜页面加密的解析和漫画爬虫</title>

      <description>最近在准备可视化课程的大作业, 正好学习一下python爬虫的知识并且实际地练练手. 就选择了漫画柜网站, 顺便也能够爬一点漫画下来到本地看. 这篇文章主要记录了一下对漫画柜网站的分析和js逆向的过程, 因为是拿来给自己看并且面向中文用户的, 所以就用中文来写了. 同时会分享一下用来下载漫画的爬虫代码. Recently during the preparation of the final project of Visualization class, I plan to learn python spider systematically. As a good choice for practice, I analyzed the logic of the website of Manhuagui(manhuagui.com) and write a simple code for download mangas efficiently. This article mainly covers the analyzation and reverses its javascript, which would be like a boring detective store. Because this article is written for Chinese web users, it is in Chinese. Sorry for those users of the English language.</description>

      <description>An introduction to weak measurement and weak values. Using the simplest model and perturbation theory to analyze a class of weak measurement process and the concept of weak values. This article gives a comparison between weak measurement and the ordinary measurement in quantum mechanics(which is called as strong measurement) and some interesting application of weak values.</description>
