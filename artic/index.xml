      <description>Time travel, as a famous concept in science fiction, fascinates people for a long time. However for physicists, this is not only a beautiful dream, but also a interesting problem to discuss mathematically. In the community, there are generally two directions about time travel: (1) does it exist and (2) if it indeed exists, what can we do. In this report, we discuss the application of time travel mainly in the field of quantum computation</description>

      <description>最近在准备可视化课程的大作业, 正好学习一下python爬虫的知识并且实际地练练手. 就选择了漫画柜网站, 顺便也能够爬一点漫画下来到本地看. 这篇文章主要记录了一下对漫画柜网站的分析和js逆向的过程, 因为是拿来给自己看并且面向中文用户的, 所以就用中文来写了. 同时会分享一下用来下载漫画的爬虫代码. Recently during the preparation of the final project of Visualization class, I plan to learn python spider systematically. As a good choice for practice, I analyzed the logic of the website of Manhuagui(manhuagui.com) and write a simple code for download mangas efficiently. This article mainly covers the analyzation and reverses its javascript, which would be like a boring detective store. Because this article is written for Chinese web users, it is in Chinese. Sorry for those users of the English language.</description>

      <description>An introduction to weak measurement and weak values. Using the simplest model and perturbation theory to analyze a class of weak measurement process and the concept of weak values. This article gives a comparison between weak measurement and the ordinary measurement in quantum mechanics(which is called as strong measurement) and some interesting application of weak values.</description>
